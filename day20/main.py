# howdyðŸ‘‹
# so this one as easy but i fell for jumping into a 'neat' / mathy solution and took too long with it
# its a story about the dance between hustirics, algorithms, and simulations
# i jumped into integer factorization and finding the number that way but it didnt work well for large numbers (would hang)
# so i then tried to incorporate binary search with this. with no luck with this, i decided to look at what this function even looks like
# https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisorFunction.html
# funny, before i decided to peek at reddit, I was thinking "maybe hill-climbing w/ binary search". that looking at the function, that would have sucked
# 
# hints on reddit just said: do it the dumb way. Eureka!  I remembered something: 3600000 integers isnt that much. merely simulating the elves is much faster
